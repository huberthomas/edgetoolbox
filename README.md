## Installation
For installation I would recommend using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) package management system. It is easy to install and you can handle different environments that can have different versions of applications. This is very useful when trying out different algorithms that have different dependencies.

### Dependencies

To install all necessary dependencies please use conda or pip. Conda is recommended because it creates its' own environment where it installs all needed packages independently from other projects.

### Literature

[Hackers Guide to Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/)

### Conda

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    
### Python pip

    pip install -r requirements.txt --user
