See the license file.

## Installation
For installation I would recommend using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) package management system. It is easy to install and you can handle different environments that can have different versions of applications. This is very useful when trying out different algorithms that have different dependencies.

### Dependencies

    conda install sympy cv2 opencv numpy matplotlib
